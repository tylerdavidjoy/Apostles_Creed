# Apostles Creed

This was a project for a senior level game design course. Our challenge was to build a game that was related to Christianity. Being a fan of Ubisoft's Assassins Creed and the actual Apostles Creed I found it an interesting challenge to implement a variation in which Jesus goes around saving sinners.

In this game, you play as Jesus Christ, you are able to climb walls and take leaps of faith to sneak around sinners and bring them to the light.
